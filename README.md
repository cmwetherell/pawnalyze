# Pawnalyze Website

This repository contains the source code for the Pawnalyze website, a chess analytics platform designed to offer insights into chess tournaments and the complexity of chess positions. Built with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS, this project showcases the intersection of chess enthusiasm and data science expertise.

## TODO

- make connection with Lichess broadcasts. Save new torunaments to DB and stream their results, including save each round complexity analysis to DB.
- fix site manifest
- better logo
- improve process for adding new simulations and deleting stale ones

db sturcture for connecting Lichess Broadcasts and Elocator
